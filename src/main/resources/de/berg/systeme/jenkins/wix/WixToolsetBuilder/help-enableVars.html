  <p>Adds all available system environment variables as parameters to the WiX Compiler
  candle. This behaviour is similar to candle's option -d. Every environment
  variable is represented as a separate parameter.</p>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Some environment variables like <i>PATH</i> can cause strange
  behaviour and lead to errors in compilation because of the usage of some forbidden 
  characters. To prevent addition of some defined environment variables, use the rejection list.</p>
  <p>Details on the <a href="http://wixtoolset.org/documentation/manual/v3/overview/preprocessor.html">usage of parameters</a> in the preprocessor can be found on the
  official pages for the WiX toolset.</p>
